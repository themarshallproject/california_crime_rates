,,Wisconsin - The state UCR Program was unable to provide complete 1998 offense figures in accordance with UCR guidelines.  The state total was estimated by using 1997 figures for the nonreporting areas and applying 1997 versus 1998 percentage changes for the division in which Wisconsin is located.  The estimates for the nonreporting areas were then increased by any actual 1998 crime counts received.,,,,,,,,,
